# How?
The first intial batch of models & configs (start - 12-28-24) was scraped via a simple C# console app I made, the new batch (12-29-24 - 07-25-25) was just downloaded manually using the Discord search built into the app. (`in:#ðŸ“¦ãƒ»models has:file`)  
The new batch of configs (12-29-24 - 06-14-25) was scraped using the same simple C# app, they were then validated using a python script.
# Why?
Plain and simple reason why was just to make it some what easier to find and download models & configs for Aimmy or any other program that can use the models.

# How do I add my model?
Simply make a model post to [|# ðŸ“¦ãƒ»models|](https://discord.com/channels/1172932293288013936/1175942737632178256) with the model uploaded as a file directly to **Discord**, downloads such as mediafire or google drive are NOT supported.

# Removing your model
Either message me on Discord (@whoswhip) or make an issue ticket.
When messaging me or making an issue ticket PLEASE prefix your message/title with "Model Removal:", provide the model name, file hash (optional), and a reason for removing it.
To get the hash you can open Powershell and type `Get-FileHash .\filename.onnx`
All requests WILL be checked to see if you are the original poster of the model.
