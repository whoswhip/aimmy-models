# How?
The first intial batch of models & configs (start - 12-28-24) was scraped via a simple C# console app I made, the new batch (12-29-24 - 06-09-25) was just downloaded manually using the Discord search built into the app. (`in:#📦・models has:file`)  
The new batch of configs (12-29-24 - 06-14-25) was scraped using the same simple C# app, they were then validated using a python script.
# Why?
Plain and simple reason why was just to make it some what easier to find and download models & configs for Aimmy or any other program that can use the models.
